# 🚗 Advanced EDA: Used Car Auction Market Analysis

## 📍 Project Summary

This project explores the U.S. used car auction industry with a focus on fleet procurement. The goal is to support a client who leases Ford F150s to contractors and is facing supply shortages from traditional sources. The analysis identifies cost-effective procurement opportunities from automotive auctions using real-world data.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand trends in the used car auction market  
- Analyze factors influencing vehicle selling price  
- Compare auction selling prices against MMR (Manheim Market Report) values  
- Locate high-volume auction regions offering Ford F150s below market price

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Seaborn** & **Matplotlib** for advanced visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** for exploration and presentation

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- Pair plots of vehicle attributes  
- Histograms of vehicle year, condition, and odometer  
- Linear regression (`lmplot`) of price vs. key variables  
- Heatmaps of correlation between features  
- Grouped bar charts for average price and count by date/location

## 🔎 Key Findings

- Certain regions (e.g., Utah) offer Ford F150s significantly below their MMR value  
- Condition and odometer are strong indicators of price  
- Many cars are sold below market value even when in good condition  
- Some dates show a spike in auction volume, indicating procurement opportunities
